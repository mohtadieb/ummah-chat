  'A noble woman chosen by Allah, who devoted herself to worship and was blessed with a miraculous child, Isa (as).',
  body:
  'Maryam (peace be upon her) was one of the most honoured women in history. '
      'Her mother had promised that the child in her womb would be dedicated to the worship and service of Allah. '
      'When Maryam was born, her mother still kept her promise and asked Allah to protect Maryam and her descendants from Shaytan.\n\n'
      'Maryam (as) grew up in a place of worship, cared for by Prophet Zakariya (as). '
      'She spent her time remembering Allah, praying, and living a life of modesty and purity. '
      'Her heart was attached to her Lord.\n\n'
      'Zakariya (as) would visit her and find special food with her that no one had brought. '
      'When he asked her where it came from, she replied that it was from Allah, who provides for whom He wills.\n\n'
      'One day, while Maryam (as) was alone, an angel came to her in the form of a man. '
      'She was afraid and asked him not to come near if he feared Allah. '
      'The angel explained that he was a messenger from Allah, sent to give her the news that she would have a pure son.\n\n'
      'Maryam (as) was amazed and said that no man had ever touched her. '
      'The angel told her that this was a command from Allah, and that for Allah, nothing is impossible. '
      'Her child would be a sign for the people and a mercy from Allah.\n\n'
      'Maryam (as) became pregnant with Prophet Isa (Jesus, as) by the will of Allah, without a father. '
      'When the time of birth came, she went to a distant place, feeling great pain and sadness. '
      'She was worried about what people would say and how she would face them.\n\n'
      'In that difficult moment, Allah comforted her. '
      'She was told not to be sad, and a stream of water flowed near her. '
      'She was instructed to shake the trunk of a palm tree, and fresh dates fell for her to eat and regain her strength.\n\n'
      'After Isa (as) was born, Maryam (as) returned to her people carrying her baby. '
      'They were shocked and accused her without thinking, forgetting her pure character.\n\n'
      'Allah commanded Maryam (as) to remain silent and to point to her baby when they questioned her. '
      'When the people told her that a baby could not speak, Isa (as), still a baby in the cradle, spoke by Allah’s permission. '
      'He declared that he was a servant of Allah and a prophet, and that Allah had blessed him.\n\n'
      'From the story of Maryam (as), we learn about purity, modesty, sincere worship, and trusting Allah even in the most lonely and frightening moments. '
      'We also learn that Allah can create in any way He wills, and that honour with Allah is not about wealth or status, but about a heart attached to Him.',
