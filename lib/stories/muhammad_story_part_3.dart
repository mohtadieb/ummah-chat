  'The first followers of Islam, the secret meetings, and how a small group of believers grew in faith.',
  body:
  'After the first revelation, more verses of the Qur’an were sent to the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). '
      'They called people to worship only Allah, to leave idols, and to have good manners and a pure heart. '
      'At the beginning, he did not call everyone in public. Instead, he started with those closest to him.\n\n'
      'The very first person to believe in him was his wife Khadijah (ra). '
      'Then his young cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib (ra), who lived in his home, accepted Islam. '
      'His freed servant and adopted son Zaid ibn Harithah (ra) also believed in him quickly.\n\n'
      'His close friend Abu Bakr (ra), who knew his honesty better than anyone, accepted Islam without hesitation. '
      'Abu Bakr (ra) was gentle and respected, and he quietly invited others to Islam. '
      'Through him, many early companions accepted the new faith, including Uthman ibn Affan, Talha, Zubair, and others (may Allah be pleased with them all).\n\n'
      'Because the people of Quraysh were strongly attached to idol worship and their old ways, the Prophet (ﷺ) did not yet call everyone openly. '
      'The Muslims met in secret to learn the Qur’an, to pray, and to strengthen their faith. '
      'One of the places where they gathered was the house of a man named Al-Arqam, near the Kaaba. '
      'This house became a small school of faith and patience.\n\n'
      'The early Muslims faced many challenges even in this secret phase. '
      'Some families became angry when they found out their relatives had accepted Islam. '
      'But the believers knew that Allah was watching them, and they remained patient.\n\n'
      'In these early years, the Qur’an focused on building the heart: teaching about the Oneness of Allah, the Hereafter, Paradise and Hell, and the stories of earlier prophets. '
      'The believers learned to love Allah, to fear displeasing Him, and to care for one another.\n\n'
      'Even though they were small in number, Allah honoured them. '
      'They were not powerful in money or weapons, but they were strong in faith, trust in Allah, and love for the Prophet (ﷺ).\n\n'
      'Slowly, more people from different backgrounds joined them: young and old, rich and poor, free people and slaves. '
      'Islam welcomed them all and taught that the best person is the one who is most pious, not the one with the most wealth or status.\n\n'
      'From this part of the story, we see that Allah often begins great changes with a small, sincere group. '
      'We also learn that real strength comes from faith and good character, not from loud numbers or worldly power.\n\n'
      'The early Muslims were planting the seeds of a future strong community, even while they were learning quietly in the house of Al-Arqam.',
