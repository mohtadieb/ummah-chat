  'A prophet sent to a people who cheated in trade. He called them to worship Allah and be fair, but many refused to listen.',
  body:
  'Prophet Shuayb (peace be upon him) was sent to the people of Madyan. They lived in a town that had trade, markets, and business. '
      'Instead of being grateful to Allah, many of them became greedy. They cheated others when buying and selling, gave less in measure and weight, '
      'and tried to gain more money in unfair ways. They also worshipped false gods besides Allah.\n\n'
      'Allah sent Shuayb (as) as a messenger to guide them back to the straight path. He spoke to them kindly but firmly. '
      'He told them to worship Allah alone, to stop cheating people, and to be honest in their trade. He warned them that cheating in business is a serious sin, '
      'and that Allah is always watching everything we do.\n\n'
      'Shuayb (as) reminded his people of the blessings that Allah had given them: good land, trade routes, and provision. '
      'He told them that if they were honest and thankful, Allah would increase their blessings. But if they continued in their injustice, a punishment could come.\n\n'
      'Many of the leaders in his people did not like this message. They loved their money and their power. They mocked Shuayb (as) and told him to stop talking about fairness. '
      'Some even threatened to drive him and his followers out of the town if they did not return to the old ways. Shuayb (as) remained patient and calm. '
      'He said that he only wanted to reform them as much as he could, and that his success was only with Allah.\n\n'
      'A few people believed in him and followed him, but most turned away and continued to cheat. They did not take the warning seriously, '
      'even when they remembered past nations who were destroyed for their arrogance.\n\n'
      'When they completely rejected the message, the punishment of Allah finally came. A terrible cry and an earthquake struck them. '
      'In a moment, their town and homes were destroyed, and those who denied the truth were left lying lifeless in their houses. '
      'Meanwhile, Allah saved Shuayb (as) and those who believed with him.\n\n'
      'From the story of Prophet Shuayb (as), we learn that Islam cares not only about prayer and fasting, but also about honesty in business and everyday life. '
      'Cheating, lying, and taking people’s rights are major sins. We also learn to stay patient when people reject the truth, and to trust that Allah’s justice will always prevail in the end.',
