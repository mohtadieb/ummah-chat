  'The prophet who made heartfelt dua for a child and was blessed with Yahya (as) in his old age.',
  body:
  'Prophet Zakariya (peace be upon him) was a gentle and devoted prophet who served Allah and taught his people to worship only Him. '
      'He lived a simple life and spent much of his time in worship and caring for the place of prayer.\n\n'
      'Zakariya (as) looked after Maryam (as) when she was a young girl devoted to worship. '
      'He would visit her in her prayer room and often found fruits and food that no one had brought. '
      'When he asked her where it came from, she replied that it was from Allah, for Allah provides for whom He wills without limit.\n\n'
      'Seeing these miracles around Maryam (as) made Zakariya (as) think deeply. '
      'He and his wife were very old and had no children, but he still longed for a righteous child who would continue the message of Islam after him. '
      'So, with a sincere heart, he raised his hands and made dua.\n\n'
      'He did not complain about his age or lose hope. He simply asked Allah with trust and humility to grant him a child, a heir who would be pleasing to Allah. '
      'Allah responded to his dua in a beautiful way.\n\n'
      'Angels came to Zakariya (as) with good news: Allah would bless him with a son named Yahya. '
      'This child would be pure, gentle, and a prophet of Allah. Zakariya (as) was amazed and asked how this could be when he was old and his wife was unable to have children, '
      'but Allah reminded him that He creates whatever He wills.\n\n'
      'As a sign, Allah told Zakariya (as) that he would not be able to speak to people for three days except through signals, even though he would be healthy. '
      'During this time, he was to remember Allah much and praise Him morning and evening.\n\n'
      'Yahya (as) was born as Allah had promised. He grew up to be a righteous, kind, and humble prophet, just as Zakariya (as) had hoped. '
      'He called people to obey Allah, spoke with wisdom, and was known for his purity and honesty.\n\n'
      'From the story of Zakariya (as), we learn the power of dua and never giving up hope in Allah, even when something seems impossible. '
      'We also learn that righteous children are a blessing and trust from Allah, not just for our happiness, but for continuing goodness in the world.',
