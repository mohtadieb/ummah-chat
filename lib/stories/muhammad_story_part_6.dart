  'The major tests in Madinah, including Badr, Uhud and the Trench, and how the Prophet (ﷺ) showed courage and wisdom.',
  body:
  'In Madinah, the Muslims finally had a safe home, but that did not mean life became easy. '
      'The enemies in Makkah still wanted to destroy Islam, and some groups around Madinah also opposed the new Muslim community.\n\n'
      'Not long after the Hijrah, a famous battle took place at a place called Badr. '
      'The Muslims were few and had little equipment, while the Quraysh army was much larger and better prepared. '
      'The Prophet (ﷺ) made sincere dua to Allah, asking for His help and victory.\n\n'
      'By the mercy of Allah, the Muslims won the Battle of Badr. '
      'It was a clear sign that Allah supports those who trust Him and follow His Messenger, even when they seem weaker in worldly means.\n\n'
      'Later, another major battle took place at Uhud. '
      'At first, the Muslims were winning, but some of the archers left their positions to collect spoils, even though the Prophet (ﷺ) had told them to stay. '
      'The enemy took this chance and attacked from behind.\n\n'
      'Many Muslims were injured, and some were martyred. '
      'The Prophet (ﷺ) himself was wounded, and his helmet was pressed into his blessed face. '
      'This was a painful lesson for the believers about obeying the Prophet (ﷺ) completely, especially in times of danger.\n\n'
      'Later, a third big test came when many tribes joined together to attack Madinah. '
      'This is known as the Battle of the Trench (Al-Khandaq). '
      'Following a wise idea from a companion named Salman al-Farisi (ra), the Muslims dug a long trench around part of the city so the enemies could not easily enter.\n\n'
      'The weather was cold, food was little, and fear was great. '
      'But the Muslims remained steadfast, trusting Allah and standing together. '
      'In the end, Allah sent strong winds and confusion among the enemy ranks, and they left without defeating the Muslims.\n\n'
      'Throughout these trials, the Prophet (ﷺ) showed courage, patience and deep trust in Allah. '
      'He also always looked for peaceful solutions when possible. '
      'Later, he agreed to a peace treaty with the Quraysh at a place called Hudaybiyyah, even though some Muslims at first found its terms hard to accept.\n\n'
      'This treaty turned out to be a great victory because it gave Muslims time to spread Islam peacefully, and many people entered the religion during that period.\n\n'
      'From this part of the story, we learn that believers may face battles and tests, but they must always hold on to patience, unity, obedience to the Prophet (ﷺ), and trust in Allah’s plan.',
