  'A brave prophet and king who defeated a giant, ruled with justice, and remembered Allah with beautiful recitation.',
  body:
  'Prophet Dawud (peace be upon him) was both a prophet and a just king. Allah blessed him with great strength, wisdom, '
      'and a heart that was constantly remembering Allah. He is known in our tradition for his beautiful voice when reciting the praises of Allah, '
      'and for his deep sense of justice.\n\n'
      'As a young man, Dawud (as) lived among the people of Bani Israil. At that time, there was a powerful and frightening warrior named Jalut (Goliath). '
      'Jalut and his army caused fear among the people. Many were too scared to face him in battle. But Dawud (as), though still young, trusted completely in Allah. '
      'He did not rely on size or weapons, but on his faith. With a simple sling and a stone, and with the help of Allah, he faced Jalut and defeated him.\n\n'
      'Because of this courage, Allah gave Dawud (as) honor, respect, and leadership among his people. Later, he became their king. '
      'He did not become arrogant. Instead, he remained humble and grateful, always turning to Allah for guidance.\n\n'
      'Allah also gave Dawud (as) a special gift: when he recited the praises of Allah, the mountains and the birds would join him. '
      'They would echo and repeat his tasbih, glorifying Allah together with him. This shows how close he was to his Lord and how sincere his worship was.\n\n'
      'Dawud (as) was also known as a fair judge. People came to him with their problems and arguments, and he would listen carefully to both sides before giving a decision. '
      'One famous story is about two men who came to him with a dispute. They wanted a judgment about their sheep and their field. Allah used this situation as a test, '
      'to remind Dawud (as) to always think deeply and carefully before making a judgment. When he realized that he could have judged in a better way, he turned to Allah, '
      'asked forgiveness, and corrected himself. This shows us that even the best people can make a mistake, but the true believer quickly returns to Allah.\n\n'
      'Allah also taught Dawud (as) how to soften iron, so that he could shape it with his hands and make armor. He would make strong coats of armor as a form of work, '
      'and Allah encouraged him to be thankful and to do good deeds. He used his strength and skills in the path of Allah, not for showing off.\n\n'
      'In addition to all of this, Dawud (as) had a beautiful daily routine of worship. It is known that he would fast every other day, a very beloved fast, '
      'and he would spend part of the night in prayer and part of it resting. He divided his time between worship, judging between people, leading the community, and working with his hands.\n\n'
      'From the story of Prophet Dawud (as), we learn that true strength is not in size or weapons, but in trust in Allah. '
      'We learn that leaders must be fair, humble, and ready to admit when they are wrong. We also learn the importance of gratitude, using our skills in a good way, '
      'and remembering Allah often with our hearts and tongues.',
