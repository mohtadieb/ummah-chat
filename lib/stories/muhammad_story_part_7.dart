  'The peaceful conquest of Makkah, the Farewell Pilgrimage, and the timeless lessons from the life of the Prophet (ﷺ).',
  body:
  'After the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, many people had the chance to hear about Islam without fear of war. '
      'In those years, many tribes and individuals entered the religion, and the Muslim community grew stronger.\n\n'
      'Later, when the Quraysh and their allies broke the treaty, the Prophet (ﷺ) prepared to march to Makkah with a large Muslim army. '
      'He did not go to seek revenge but to remove oppression and open the city for the worship of Allah alone.\n\n'
      'When the Muslims entered Makkah, there was very little fighting. '
      'The Prophet (ﷺ) showed great humility: he lowered his head on his camel in gratitude to Allah, even though he was returning to the city as its powerful leader.\n\n'
      'He declared safety for those who stayed in their homes, those who went to the Kaaba, and those who stayed in the house of Abu Sufyan. '
      'Instead of punishing the people who had harmed him for many years, he forgave most of them.\n\n'
      'He entered the Kaaba and removed the idols from around it, declaring that the truth had come and falsehood had disappeared. '
      'The House of Allah was once again purified for the worship of Allah alone.\n\n'
      'Soon after, many tribes sent delegations to Madinah to accept Islam. '
      'The message that began in a small secret gathering in Makkah had now spread across the Arabian Peninsula.\n\n'
      'In the final years of his life, the Prophet (ﷺ) performed his only complete Hajj, which is known as the Farewell Pilgrimage. '
      'During this Hajj, he gave a powerful sermon to the people on the plain of Arafah.\n\n'
      'In his sermon, he reminded the Muslims to fear Allah, to treat women kindly, to avoid interest and oppression, and to hold tightly to the Qur’an and his Sunnah. '
      'He taught that all people are equal in worth, no matter their colour or background, and that the best of them are those who have the most taqwa (God-consciousness).\n\n'
      'Not long after this, the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) became ill. '
      'Even while sick, he continued to advise the Muslims, reminding them about prayer and caring for those under their responsibility. '
      'Then his blessed soul returned to Allah, and the Muslims were filled with sorrow.\n\n'
      'From this final part of his story, we learn that his life was a complete example of mercy, justice and worship. '
      'He forgave when he had power, he was humble when he was honoured, and he never forgot Allah in any moment of his life.\n\n'
      'Loving the Prophet (ﷺ) means following his teachings in our daily lives: being truthful, kind, just, patient and always turning back to Allah with a sincere heart.',
