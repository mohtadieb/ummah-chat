  'The prophet known for his extraordinary patience, who remained grateful to Allah even through years of hardship.',
  body:
  'Prophet Ayyub (peace be upon him) was a prophet blessed by Allah with wealth, good health, a large family, and great respect among his people. '
      'He was known for his kindness and generosity, always helping the poor and thanking Allah for everything he had.\n\n'
      'But Allah wanted to test Ayyub (as) to show the world the meaning of true patience and faith. '
      'One by one, his blessings began to disappear. His wealth was taken away, his land was destroyed, and his children passed away. '
      'Then, he became very sick with a long and difficult illness.\n\n'
      'Most people, when facing hardship, might become angry or hopeless. But Ayyub (as) never complained. '
      'He would say, “Allah has given me so many years of ease. If He tests me now, I will be patient.” '
      'Even when his sickness became severe and people stayed away from him, his heart remained full of gratitude to Allah.\n\n'
      'His wife stayed by his side with love and loyalty. She cared for him every day even though life became very difficult. '
      'One day, she gently asked Ayyub (as), “Why don’t you ask Allah to cure you?” '
      'Ayyub (as) replied softly that he had enjoyed many years of good health, and now that Allah was testing him, he wished to remain patient.\n\n'
      'But Ayyub (as) did make a dua — not a dua of complaint, but a dua of humility. '
      'He said, “My Lord, harm has come to me, and You are the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.” '
      'His words showed his deep trust in Allah, without anger or frustration.\n\n'
      'Allah accepted his dua in the most beautiful way. '
      'Allah told him to strike the ground with his foot. When he did, a spring of pure water burst from the earth. '
      'Allah told him to wash in it and drink from it, and by Allah’s mercy, Ayyub (as) was completely healed. '
      'His strength returned, his illness disappeared, and his skin became healthy again.\n\n'
      'Then Allah blessed him even more than before. He restored his wealth, returned his family, and increased his blessings as a reward for his patience. '
      'His wife also received great honour because she remained loyal and loving during their hardest years.\n\n'
      'The story of Prophet Ayyub (as) teaches us that patience during hardship is one of the greatest forms of worship. '
      'We learn that Allah sees every tear, every struggle, and every silent prayer. '
      'Hard times do not last forever — Allah’s mercy is always near those who trust in Him.\n\n'
      'True strength is not found in wealth or health, but in a heart that stays grateful and patient even when life becomes difficult. '
      'Ayyub (as) reminds us to never lose hope in Allah, for He can bring relief in ways we can never imagine.',
