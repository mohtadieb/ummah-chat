  'The migration from Makkah to Madinah, the welcome of the Ansar, and the building of a united Muslim community.',
  body:
  'After many years of persecution in Makkah, a new door of hope was opened by Allah. '
      'Some people from a city called Yathrib (later known as Madinah) heard the message of Islam during Hajj and accepted it. '
      'They returned to their city and invited others to believe.\n\n'
      'Soon, groups from Yathrib came to meet the Prophet (ﷺ) in secret near Makkah. '
      'They promised to believe in Allah, support the Prophet (ﷺ), and protect him if he came to their city. '
      'This was a great turning point in the history of Islam.\n\n'
      'Allah gave the Prophet (ﷺ) permission to migrate. '
      'He told his followers to leave Makkah quietly and go to Yathrib. '
      'They left behind their homes, wealth and belongings for the sake of Allah, trusting that He would provide for them.\n\n'
      'The leaders of Quraysh were angry and planned to kill the Prophet (ﷺ). '
      'By Allah’s permission, he left Makkah at night together with his close friend Abu Bakr (ra). '
      'They hid in a cave called Thawr for a few days while the enemies searched for them.\n\n'
      'At one point, the trackers reached the mouth of the cave. '
      'Abu Bakr (ra) felt worried, not for himself but for the Prophet (ﷺ). '
      'The Prophet (ﷺ) comforted him and told him that Allah was with them. '
      'Allah protected them, and the enemies turned away without seeing them.\n\n'
      'After this, they travelled to Yathrib, and the people of the city welcomed them with joy. '
      'They sang and celebrated, happy to receive the Messenger of Allah in their home. '
      'From that time on, Yathrib became known as Madinat an-Nabi – the city of the Prophet.\n\n'
      'In Madinah, the Prophet (ﷺ) built a mosque, which became the centre of prayer, learning and community life. '
      'He also created a brotherhood between the Muslims who migrated from Makkah (the Muhajirun) and the Muslims of Madinah (the Ansar). '
      'They shared their homes, food and wealth with one another.\n\n'
      'The Prophet (ﷺ) also established fair agreements with other groups in Madinah, including non-Muslims, to live together in peace and justice. '
      'Everyone in the city had rights and responsibilities.\n\n'
      'From this part of the story, we see that leaving something for Allah’s sake is never a loss. '
      'Hijrah was difficult, but it led to a strong, loving and organised Muslim community.\n\n'
      'We also learn the importance of brotherhood, sharing, and building a society based on justice, mercy and worship of Allah.',
