  'The prophet who faced Pharaoh, parted the sea by Allah’s permission, and led his people with courage and patience.',
  body:
  'Prophet Musa (peace be upon him) was born in Egypt at a time when Pharaoh was a cruel ruler. '
      'Pharaoh feared that a boy from the Children of Israel would one day challenge his power, so he ordered '
      'that newborn boys from Bani Isra’il be killed.\n\n'
      'Allah inspired the mother of baby Musa (as) to place him in a small basket and set it afloat on the river. '
      'She did this with a heart full of fear, but also full of trust in Allah. Allah caused the basket to float safely '
      'until it reached the palace of Pharaoh. There, the wife of Pharaoh, Asiyah (may Allah be pleased with her), found the baby. '
      'She felt mercy and love for him and convinced Pharaoh to let the child live and be raised in the palace.\n\n'
      'Thus, Musa (as) grew up under the care of Allah, in the house of the very man who wanted to kill boys like him. '
      'When he grew older and stronger, he saw the injustice that Pharaoh and his people were doing to the Children of Israel. '
      'One day, Musa (as) saw a man from his own people being attacked by an Egyptian. Musa (as) intervened and struck the Egyptian, '
      'but the man died from the blow. Musa (as) did not intend to kill him. He immediately turned to Allah, asking for forgiveness, '
      'and Allah forgave him.\n\n'
      'After this, Musa (as) left Egypt in fear and travelled to the land of Madyan. There he helped two sisters who were struggling '
      'to water their animals while others pushed ahead of them. He moved the heavy stone from the well for them, showing strength and good manners. '
      'Later, he was invited to their home and eventually married one of them. He stayed in Madyan for several years, living a simple, honest life.\n\n'
      'One day, as he was travelling back towards Egypt with his family, Musa (as) saw a fire on the side of a mountain. '
      'He went towards it and there, at Mount Tur, Allah spoke to him. Allah chose him as a messenger and ordered him to go to Pharaoh '
      'and call him to worship Allah alone, to free the Children of Israel, and to stop his oppression.\n\n'
      'Musa (as) felt afraid and shy, and he asked Allah to strengthen him and to make his brother Harun (as) a helper for him. '
      'Allah accepted his dua and gave him miracles. One miracle was that his staff (stick) would turn into a real snake by Allah’s permission. '
      'Another was that his hand would shine with a bright light when he took it out from under his arm.\n\n'
      'With these signs, Musa (as) went to Pharaoh and spoke calmly but clearly: to worship Allah alone and to be just. '
      'Pharaoh became arrogant and refused. He called the magicians of Egypt to challenge Musa (as). The magicians threw their ropes and sticks, '
      'and they looked like moving snakes. By Allah’s command, Musa (as) threw down his staff, and it turned into a real snake '
      'that swallowed all their tricks. The magicians realized that this was not magic, but a true miracle from Allah. They believed in Allah '
      'and fell in prostration, even though Pharaoh threatened them.\n\n'
      'After many signs and punishments sent to Pharaoh and his people, they still refused to believe. '
      'Allah then commanded Musa (as) to lead the Children of Israel out of Egypt. They travelled at night, heading towards the sea. '
      'When they reached the water, they saw Pharaoh and his army chasing them from behind. Some of Bani Isra’il panicked and said, '
      '“We are surely caught!” But Musa (as) replied with full trust in Allah: “No! Indeed, my Lord is with me; He will guide me.”\n\n'
      'Allah then commanded Musa (as) to strike the sea with his staff. The sea split into paths, standing like great walls of water, '
      'and the ground became dry. Musa (as) and his people crossed safely. When Pharaoh and his army tried to follow, the sea closed in on them, '
      'and they were drowned. The people who had been weak and oppressed were saved by the mercy of Allah.\n\n'
      'After their escape, Allah called Musa (as) to Mount Sinai for a special meeting. Musa (as) fasted and prepared himself for many nights. '
      'There, Allah spoke to him and gave him the Tablets with His commands for the people – this is the Tawrah (Torah), a book of guidance and law. '
      'It taught them how to worship Allah, how to live justly with one another, and how to remain grateful for being saved from Pharaoh.\n\n'
      'While Musa (as) was away, some of his people fell into a big mistake. A man among them, called Samiri, made a calf from gold, '
      'and some of Bani Isra’il started to worship it. When Musa (as) returned and saw this, he was very upset and angry. '
      'He reminded them of all the favors of Allah and told them to repent. Those who were sincere repented, and Allah accepted the repentance of the sincere ones, '
      'but this event became a clear lesson about how easily people can go astray when they forget Allah.\n\n'
      'The story of Musa (as) continues with many challenges: guiding his people through the desert, dealing with their complaints, and teaching them patience and trust. '
      'Throughout all these events, Musa (as) remained a strong, courageous, and humble servant of Allah. '
      'He would often turn to Allah in dua, asking for help, patience, and clear speech, and he always knew that success comes only from Allah.\n\n'
      'From the story of Prophet Musa (as), we learn to trust Allah even in the most difficult situations, to stand up against injustice, and to be brave while keeping our hearts connected to Allah. '
      'We also learn that Allah can open a way out from places we could never imagine—just like He opened a path through the sea—and that after every rescue, we must stay grateful and not fall back into disobedience.',
