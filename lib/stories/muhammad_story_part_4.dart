  'When the Prophet (ﷺ) called people openly to Islam, many opposed him, and the believers showed great patience and courage.',
  body:
  'After some time of calling to Islam in secret, Allah commanded the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) to call people openly. '
      'He climbed a hill near the Kaaba and called the different families of Quraysh by name to gather and listen.\n\n'
      'He asked them, “If I told you that an enemy army was behind this mountain ready to attack, would you believe me?” '
      'They replied, “Yes, we have never known you to lie.” '
      'He then told them that he was warning them of a severe punishment and calling them to worship only Allah.\n\n'
      'Some people listened, but many rejected the message. '
      'His own uncle Abu Lahab insulted him and told the people to turn away from him. '
      'Others mocked him, called him names, and tried to stop people from listening to the Qur’an.\n\n'
      'As more people accepted Islam, the leaders of Quraysh became worried about losing their power and their idol-based trade. '
      'They tried different tricks: they offered the Prophet (ﷺ) money, leadership and marriage to the best women if he would stop calling people to Islam. '
      'He firmly refused and told them that if they put the sun in his right hand and the moon in his left, he would still not leave his mission.\n\n'
      'The Muslims, especially those who were weak or slaves, were tortured and harmed. '
      'Some were dragged in the hot sand, others were beaten or starved. '
      'The Prophet (ﷺ) could not always physically stop it, but he encouraged them with words of hope and promised them Jannah if they stayed patient.\n\n'
      'Bilal ibn Rabah (ra), a slave who accepted Islam, was tortured by his master. '
      'He was laid on the burning ground with heavy stones on his chest, but he kept repeating, “Ahad, Ahad” – “One, One”, meaning Allah is One.\n\n'
      'Because of the persecution, the Prophet (ﷺ) advised some Muslims to migrate to Abyssinia (Habasha), a land ruled by a just Christian king. '
      'There they were allowed to live safely and practice their religion.\n\n'
      'Back in Makkah, the Quraysh placed a social and economic boycott on the Prophet’s family and supporters. '
      'They were forced to stay in a narrow valley and faced hunger and hardship for years. '
      'Still, they remained patient and trusted Allah.\n\n'
      'During this time, the Prophet (ﷺ) also suffered personal sadness. '
      'His beloved wife Khadijah (ra) passed away, and shortly after, his uncle Abu Talib, who had protected him, also died. '
      'That year is known as the “Year of Sadness”.\n\n'
      'From this part of the story, we learn that being on the truth does not always mean life will be easy. '
      'Real faith shines through patience, bravery, and trust in Allah during the most difficult moments.',
