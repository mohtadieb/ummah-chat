  body:
  'Prophet Nuh (peace be upon him) was sent by Allah to a people who worshipped idols instead of Him. '
      'They had forgotten the guidance of the earlier righteous people and began to bow to statues that they themselves had made.\n\n'
      'Nuh (as) called his people to Allah for many, many years. He spoke to them kindly, in public and in private, during the day and during the night. '
      'He reminded them that Allah is their only Lord, that He created them, provides for them, and that they would one day return to Him.\n\n'
      'He warned them about the consequences of disbelief and encouraged them with the rewards of Paradise if they believed and did good. '
      'But most of the people turned away. Some mocked him, some laughed at him, and some closed their ears when he spoke.\n\n'
      'Even though they rejected him again and again, Nuh (as) stayed patient. He did not give up his mission. He continued to invite them for centuries. '
      'Only a small group of people believed in him and followed the truth.\n\n'
      'After a very long time of rejection, Allah informed Nuh (as) that no more people from his nation would believe. '
      'Then Allah commanded him to build a huge ship — an ark — on dry land, far away from the sea.\n\n'
      'While Nuh (as) and the believers were building the ark, the disbelievers laughed and made fun of them. '
      'They said, “You used to call yourself a prophet, and now you are a carpenter building a ship in the middle of the desert!”\n\n'
      'But Nuh (as) knew that he was following Allah’s command. When the ark was finished, Allah ordered him to take pairs of animals on board, '
      'along with the believers who followed him.\n\n'
      'Then the sky opened with heavy rain, and water burst forth from the earth. What looked like normal land became covered in water. '
      'The waves grew higher and higher, like mountains. The people who had mocked Nuh (as) realized too late that the warning was true.\n\n'
      'The ark floated safely on top of the waves by the protection of Allah. Everyone inside the ark was safe, while the flood destroyed the people who rejected the truth. '
      'Among those who did not join Nuh (as) was one of his own sons, who chose to disbelieve and stay with the wrongdoers.\n\n'
      'After some time, Allah commanded the earth to swallow its water and the sky to stop its rain. The flood ended. '
      'The ark came to rest on a mountain. Nuh (as) and the believers stepped out to begin a new life on earth, based on faith and obedience to Allah.\n\n'
      'From the story of Prophet Nuh (as) we learn that:\n'
      '• A believer should be patient and keep doing good even when others laugh or reject them.\n'
      '• Guidance belongs to Allah; we must call people kindly but we cannot force their hearts.\n'
      '• Trusting Allah and obeying Him is the only true safety — in this life and the next.\n',
