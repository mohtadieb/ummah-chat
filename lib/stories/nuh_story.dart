  'The prophet who called his people for many years, built an ark by Allah’s command, and trusted Allah in the storm.',
  body:
  'Prophet Nuh (peace be upon him) was sent to a people who had forgotten Allah and started worshipping idols. '
      'They made statues and gave them names, hoping they would bring them closer to Allah. But these idols could not hear, see, or help anyone.\n\n'
      'Allah chose Nuh (as) to remind his people of the truth. He called them day and night, in public and in private, with gentle words and clear warnings. '
      'He told them that Allah is their true Lord, that they should worship Him alone, and that they should ask for forgiveness.\n\n'
      'Nuh (as) spoke to them with patience for many, many years — some narrations mention 950 years of calling his people. '
      'Still, most of them refused to listen. They covered their ears, pulled their clothes over their heads, and turned away whenever he spoke. '
      'They mocked him and called him names, but he did not stop inviting them to Allah.\n\n'
      'Only a small group believed in him. These believers were not always rich or powerful; many were simple, humble people. '
      'The leaders of the community looked down on them and used them as an excuse not to follow Nuh (as).\n\n'
      'After a very long time of da’wah and rejection, Nuh (as) made dua to Allah, asking for help. '
      'Allah informed him that no more people would believe except those who had already believed. '
      'Then Allah gave Nuh (as) a special command: to build a large ark (ship) under Allah’s guidance.\n\n'
      'Nuh (as) began to build the ark far away from the sea. The disbelievers laughed at him and made fun of him, saying, '
      '“Have you become a carpenter now?” They could not understand why a ship was being built on dry land.\n\n'
      'When the ark was ready, Allah commanded Nuh (as) to take with him the believers and pairs of animals. '
      'Then, the sky began to pour with heavy rain, and water burst from the earth. '
      'The waters rose and rose until they covered homes, trees, and mountains. The great flood had begun.\n\n'
      'Inside the ark, Nuh (as) and the believers were safe by Allah’s mercy. '
      'The ship sailed over the strong waves while the rest of the land was flooded. '
      'Nuh (as) trusted Allah completely during this frightening time.\n\n'
      'Among those who refused to board the ark was one of Nuh’s own sons. Nuh (as) felt great sadness and called to him, asking him to come aboard and be safe. '
      'But his son chose to trust a mountain instead of Allah’s command and was lost in the flood.\n\n'
      'After some time, the rain stopped, and the water slowly went down. The ark came to rest on a mountain. '
      'Nuh (as) and the believers left the ship and began a new life, starting a fresh community based on faith in Allah.\n\n'
      'From the story of Nuh (as), we learn about patience in giving da’wah, trusting Allah even when others mock us, and understanding that true safety lies in obeying Allah, not in things or places.\n\n'
      'We also learn that guidance is in Allah’s hands. Our duty is to invite others kindly and to remain steadfast, just like Nuh (as) did for so many years.',
