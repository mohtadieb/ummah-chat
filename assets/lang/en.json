    "subtitle": "The first human, the first prophet, and the beginning of our story",
    "cardPreview": "The first human created by Allah, who lived in Jannah and taught us about repentance and mercy.",
    "body": "Prophet Adam (peace be upon him) was the first human and the first prophet. Allah created Adam (as) from clay and shaped him with His own hands. Then Allah breathed His spirit into him, and Adam (as) came to life. Allah honored him by teaching him the names of all things and granting him knowledge that even the angels did not have.\n\nAllah commanded the angels to bow to Adam (as) as a sign of honor, not worship. They all obeyed except Iblis. Iblis was arrogant and full of pride. He believed he was better than Adam (as) because he was created from fire, while Adam (as) was created from clay. He refused to obey Allah and became one of the disbelievers. From that moment on, Iblis became the enemy of Adam (as) and all of his descendants.\n\nAllah gave Adam (as) a home in Jannah, a beautiful garden filled with rivers, trees, and blessings. Allah gave him a wife, Hawwa (Eve), and together they lived in peace. They were allowed to enjoy everything in Jannah except for one specific tree. Allah clearly warned them not to eat from that tree.\n\nHowever, Iblis wanted Adam (as) and Hawwa to disobey Allah so that they would lose the blessings of Jannah. He whispered to them and tried to deceive them. He told them that if they ate from the forbidden tree, they would become like angels or live forever. He made the sin seem small and attractive. In a moment of weakness, Adam (as) and Hawwa listened to his whispers and ate from the tree.\n\nAs soon as they did so, they realized their mistake. Their clothing of light disappeared, and they felt exposed and ashamed. They quickly covered themselves with leaves from the trees of Jannah. They knew they had disobeyed Allah.\n\nAdam (as) and Hawwa immediately turned back to Allah in repentance. They did not blame anyone else. They made a sincere supplication and asked Allah for forgiveness. Allah taught them the words of repentance and accepted their tawbah. This shows us that even when we make mistakes, the door of Allah’s mercy remains open when we return to Him.\n\nAfter that, Allah sent Adam (as) and Hawwa down to the earth. This was part of Allah’s plan, as He had already decided that humans would live on earth in generations, worship Him, and build a life there. Allah informed them that they and their children would live on earth, sometimes facing difficulties and trials, but also receiving guidance from Him. Whoever follows that guidance will be safe, and whoever turns away from it will be lost.\n\nAdam (as) lived on earth as a prophet and taught his children to worship Allah alone, to be grateful, and to stay away from the whispers of Shaytan. With him began all of humanity. Everyone alive today is one of his descendants.\n\nFrom the story of Prophet Adam (as), we learn many important lessons: that Allah created us with honor and purpose; that Shaytan is our clear enemy; that sins can happen, but the true believer quickly returns to Allah with sincere repentance; and that Allah is the Most Forgiving and Most Merciful to those who turn back to Him.",

    "body": "Prophet Ayyub (peace be upon him) was a prophet whom Allah had blessed with wealth, good health, a large family, and respect among his people. He was known for his kindness and generosity and always helped the poor, while thanking Allah for everything he had.\n\nBut Allah wished to test Ayyub (as) to show the world what true patience and faith truly mean. One by one, his blessings were taken away. His wealth was lost, his land destroyed, and his children passed away. After that, he was struck with a long and severe illness.\n\nMany people would become angry or hopeless during hardship, but Ayyub (as) never complained. He said: “Allah granted me many years of ease. If He now tests me, I will remain patient.” Even when his illness worsened and people began to avoid him, his heart remained full of gratitude toward Allah.\n\nHis wife remained loving and loyal by his side. She cared for him every day, even when life became extremely difficult. One day, she gently asked him, “Why do you not ask Allah to cure you?” Ayyub (as) calmly replied that he had enjoyed many years of good health and that during this test from Allah, he wished to remain patient.\n\nStill, Ayyub (as) made a supplication—not a supplication of complaint, but of humility. He said: “My Lord, indeed adversity has touched me, and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful.” His words reflected deep trust in Allah, without anger or frustration.\n\nAllah answered his supplication in the most beautiful way. Allah commanded him to strike the ground with his foot. When he did so, a spring of pure water emerged from the earth. Allah commanded him to wash with it and drink from it, and by Allah’s mercy, Ayyub (as) was completely cured. His strength returned, and his illness disappeared.\n\nAfter that, Allah blessed him even more than before. His wealth was restored, his family returned, and his blessings were multiplied as a reward for his patience. His wife was also honored for her loyalty and devotion during their most difficult years.\n\nThe story of Prophet Ayyub (as) teaches us that patience during trials is one of the greatest forms of worship. Allah sees every tear, every struggle, and every silent prayer. Difficult times do not last forever—Allah’s mercy is always near for those who trust in Him.\n\nTrue strength is not found in wealth or health, but in a heart that remains grateful and patient even when life becomes heavy. Ayyub (as) reminds us never to lose hope in Allah, for He can bring relief in ways we could never imagine.",

    "body": "Prophet Dawud (peace be upon him) was both a prophet and a just king. Allah blessed him with great strength, wisdom, and a heart that constantly remembered Allah. He is well known for his beautiful voice in reciting the praises of Allah and for his deep sense of justice.\n\nAs a young man, Dawud (as) lived among the people of Bani Israil. At that time, there was a powerful and terrifying warrior named Jalut (Goliath). Jalut and his army spread fear among the people, and many were too afraid to face him. Dawud (as), though young, placed complete trust in Allah. He relied not on size or weapons, but on faith. With a simple sling and a stone, and by Allah’s permission, he faced Jalut and defeated him.\n\nBecause of this courage, Allah granted Dawud (as) honor, respect, and leadership among his people. He later became their king. He did not become arrogant, but remained humble and grateful, always turning to Allah for guidance.\n\nAllah also gave Dawud (as) a special gift: when he praised Allah, the mountains and birds joined him in glorifying Allah. This showed how close he was to his Lord and how sincere his worship was.\n\nDawud (as) was also known as a just judge. People came to him with their disputes, and he listened carefully to both sides before making a judgment. One well-known incident involved two men who came to him with a dispute over sheep and farmland. Allah used this as a test to remind Dawud (as) to always reflect deeply before judging. When he realized he could have judged better, he turned to Allah, sought forgiveness, and corrected himself. This teaches us that even the best people can make mistakes, but a true believer returns quickly to Allah.\n\nAllah also taught Dawud (as) how to soften iron, allowing him to shape it with his hands and make strong armor. He worked with his hands and was encouraged by Allah to be grateful and do good deeds, using his skills in the path of Allah.\n\nDawud (as) also had a beautiful routine of worship. It is known that he fasted every other day — one of the most beloved forms of fasting — and spent part of the night in prayer and part resting. He balanced worship, leadership, justice, and work.\n\nFrom the story of Prophet Dawud (as), we learn that true strength lies not in size or weapons, but in trust in Allah. We learn that leaders must be just, humble, and willing to admit mistakes, and that gratitude and remembrance of Allah give life true meaning.",

    "body": "Prophet Hud (peace be upon him) was sent to the people of ‘Ad. They were a very strong and powerful nation. They built tall pillars and impressive buildings in the region of Al-Ahqaf and were proud of their strength. Instead of being grateful to Allah, they became arrogant. They worshipped idols, oppressed others, and believed that no one could defeat them.\n\nAllah sent Hud (as) to guide them. He was from among them, spoke their language, and cared deeply for them. He called them to worship Allah alone, to stop worshipping idols, and to fear Allah who had given them everything they possessed. He reminded them that their strength and beautiful homes were gifts from Allah, not reasons for pride or injustice.\n\nHud (as) told them that if they believed and obeyed Allah, He would increase them in blessings. But if they continued in arrogance and disbelief, punishment would come. The leaders of ‘Ad mocked him. They said things like, “Who is stronger than us?” and accused Hud (as) of foolishness. They refused to give up their pride and idols.\n\nHud (as) remained patient. He made it clear that he did not ask them for any reward and that his reward was only with Allah. He warned them again and again over many years. Only a small group believed in him and followed his message.\n\nWhen the people completely refused to listen, Allah’s punishment began. First, their land became dry. Rain stopped, and the people of ‘Ad hoped for clouds to bring rain. One day they saw a huge dark cloud approaching and felt happy, thinking it would bring water. But that cloud carried a violent, freezing wind. The wind blew with great force for many days, destroying their homes and throwing their bodies to the ground. The mighty nation of ‘Ad, which thought it could never be defeated, was wiped out. Only Hud (as) and the believers with him were saved.\n\nAllah mentions the people of ‘Ad in the Qur’an as a warning to others: power and wealth do not protect you if you are arrogant and disobedient. True safety lies in obeying Allah and remaining humble.\n\nFrom the story of Prophet Hud (as), we learn not to be proud of our strength, our homes, or our achievements. Everything we have is a gift from Allah, and He can take it away whenever He wills.

    "body": "Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) is one of the greatest messengers of Allah and is called “Khalilullah” – the close friend of Allah. He is known for his pure belief in One God (tawheed), his courage, and his complete trust in Allah during the most difficult trials.\n\nIbrahim (as) grew up in a society that worshipped idols, stars, the moon, and the sun. Even his own father made idols. From a young age, Ibrahim (as) questioned everything around him. He saw the stars appear at night and disappear at dawn, the moon shine and then fade, and the sun rise and set. He realized that something which disappears cannot be the true God. He understood that the true God must be the One who created all these things and never disappears.\n\nHe began speaking to his people with wisdom and questions. He asked them why they worshipped statues that could not hear, see, or help themselves. He gently tried to guide his father to the truth, but his father refused and even threatened him. Still, Ibrahim (as) remained respectful and said that he would pray for his father.\n\nOne day, when the people left the city for a festival, Ibrahim (as) went to the place where the idols were kept. He broke the smaller idols and left only the largest one standing, placing the axe on it. When the people returned, they were shocked and asked who had done this. Ibrahim (as) said they should ask the biggest idol – if it could speak. Deep down, they realized that idols could do nothing, but their pride stopped many of them from accepting the truth.\n\nThe leaders became extremely angry and decided to punish Ibrahim (as). They built a massive fire, so hot that they had to throw him into it using a catapult. At that moment, Ibrahim (as) turned his heart completely to Allah. Allah then commanded the fire: “O fire, be cool and safe for Ibrahim.” The fire did not harm him at all. He emerged unharmed – a clear sign that Allah protects those who trust Him.\n\nAfter this, Ibrahim (as) migrated for the sake of Allah. He traveled to different lands, continuing to call people to worship Allah alone. For many years, he and his wife Sarah (as) had no children. Later, Allah blessed him with two sons: Ismail (as) and Ishaq (as), peace be upon them both. They would also become prophets and ancestors of prophets.\n\nAllah then tested Ibrahim (as) with another great trial. He commanded him to take Hajar (as) and baby Ismail (as) to a barren valley – what would later become Makkah. There were no trees, no water, and no people. Ibrahim (as) left them there by Allah’s command. When Hajar (as) asked if Allah had ordered this and he nodded yes, she replied with full trust that Allah would never abandon them.\n\nWhen the food and water ran out and baby Ismail (as) cried from thirst, Hajar (as) ran between the hills of Safa and Marwah searching for help – seven times back and forth – full of worry, yet full of trust in Allah. Then Allah caused the water of Zamzam to spring forth from beneath the feet of baby Ismail (as). This blessed water still flows in Makkah today, and running between Safa and Marwah became part of the rituals of Hajj and Umrah.\n\nLater, when Ismail (as) had grown older, Allah tested Ibrahim (as) again. In a dream, he saw that he was sacrificing his son. The dreams of prophets are revelation, so he knew this was a command from Allah. He spoke to Ismail (as), who showed his own faith and told his father to do what Allah had commanded and that he would be patient.\n\nWhen both of them submitted to Allah’s will and Ibrahim (as) was ready to carry out the sacrifice, Allah called out to him and stopped it. Ismail (as) was replaced with a ram, and Allah made it clear that the test was about sincerity and obedience, not the sacrifice itself. This event is remembered every year during Eid al-Adha.\n\nAnother great honor for Ibrahim (as) was building the Ka‘bah. Allah commanded Ibrahim (as) and his son Ismail (as) to raise the foundations of the House in Makkah. Together they built the Ka‘bah as a place where Allah alone would be worshipped. While building, they made dua that Allah would accept their work, make them obedient to Him, and send a messenger from their descendants to teach the Book and wisdom. This dua was fulfilled with the sending of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\nAllah also commanded Ibrahim (as) to call people to Hajj, even though the valley was empty at that time. He obeyed, and Allah caused that call to reach the hearts of people all over the world. To this day, millions of Muslims travel to Makkah every year to answer that same call.\n\nThroughout his life, Ibrahim (as) made beautiful duas mentioned in the Qur’an – for a righteous family, for the safety of Makkah, and for forgiveness for himself and his descendants. In every situation, he remained humble, grateful, and devoted to Allah.\n\nFrom the story of Prophet Ibrahim (as), we learn that true iman means trusting Allah completely, even when His commands are difficult. We learn that sacrifice and patience bring us closer to Allah, that tawheed is the heart of our religion, and that Allah never abandons those who sincerely obey Him.",

    "cardPreview": "A prophet born without a father, who spoke as a baby, performed miracles by Allah’s permission, and will return before the end of time.",
    "body": "Prophet Isa (peace be upon him) was one of the greatest messengers of Allah. He was born miraculously to Maryam (as), a pure and righteous woman, without a father. Allah mentions in the Qur’an that when the angels gave Maryam the glad tidings, she was astonished and asked how this could happen. Allah reminded her that He only says: “Be,” and it is. Nothing is impossible for Allah.\n\nMaryam (as) withdrew to a secluded place, where Isa (as) was born. When she returned to her people carrying the baby, they were shocked and falsely accused her. Maryam (as) did not argue with them. Instead, she pointed to the baby. By Allah’s permission, Isa (as) spoke while still in the cradle. He declared that he was a servant of Allah, that Allah had given him a Book, made him a prophet, and commanded him to pray and give charity. From his very first words, he made it clear that he belonged to Allah and was not a god.\n\nAs Isa (as) grew up, he became known for his purity, wisdom, and kindness. He called his people to worship Allah alone, without partners. He reminded them to follow the straight path, obey Allah’s commands, and purify their hearts from pride and hypocrisy.\n\nAllah supported him with clear miracles. By Allah’s permission, he healed those born blind and those afflicted with leprosy. By Allah’s permission, he brought the dead back to life. He also shaped a bird from clay, and by Allah’s permission it became a living bird. All of these miracles were signs, not magic, showing that Allah is All-Powerful and that Isa (as) was truly His messenger.\n\nAllah gave Isa (as) the Injil (Gospel) as a book of guidance and light. He confirmed the truth of the Tawrah (Torah) that came before him and made some matters easier for his people. He taught mercy, kindness, and humility, and encouraged care for the poor, the sick, and the weak. He had close companions who believed in him and supported his message; they were called the Hawariyyun.\n\nOne day, some of his followers asked for a special sign: a table spread with food sent down from heaven, so that their hearts would be reassured and their faith strengthened. Isa (as) warned them to fear Allah and not ask for signs without need, but when they persisted sincerely, he made dua. Allah sent down the table as a clear sign and warned that whoever disbelieved afterward would face severe punishment.\n\nDespite all these signs, many leaders among Bani Isra’il rejected Isa (as). Fearing the loss of their status and power, they spread lies about him and plotted against him. They intended to kill him, but Allah is the Best of planners. They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; it was only made to appear so to them. Allah raised Isa (as) to Himself and saved him from their plot.\n\nIslam teaches that Isa (as) is alive and will return before the end of time as a great sign. When he returns, he will break the cross, defeat the false messiah (Dajjal), and clarify the truth about himself: that he is a servant and messenger of Allah, not a god. He will rule with justice, and there will be a time of peace and fairness on earth.\n\nAs Muslims, we love and deeply respect Isa (as). We believe he was a human being honored by Allah, like all prophets. He called people to tawheed — worshipping Allah alone. We do not worship him, but we follow the message he brought: to obey Allah and purify our hearts.\n\nFrom the story of Prophet Isa (as), we learn that miracles belong only to Allah, even when they appear through His prophets. We learn to remain firm upon the truth, even when others misunderstand us or spread lies. We also learn to remain humble, gentle, and full of mercy, remembering that true honor lies in being a servant of Allah, not in being praised by people.",

    "body": "Maryam (peace be upon her) was one of the most honored women in history. Her mother had promised that the child in her womb would be devoted to the worship and service of Allah. When Maryam was born, her mother kept that promise and asked Allah to protect Maryam and her descendants from Shaytan.\n\nMaryam (as) grew up in a place of worship, cared for by Prophet Zakariya (as). She spent her time remembering Allah, praying, and living a life of modesty and purity. Her heart was connected to her Lord.\n\nZakariya (as) would visit her and find special food with her that no one had brought. When he asked where it came from, she replied that it was from Allah, who provides for whom He wills.\n\nOne day, when Maryam (as) was alone, an angel came to her in the form of a man. She was frightened and asked him not to come near if he feared Allah. The angel explained that he was a messenger from Allah, sent to give her the news that she would have a pure son.\n\nMaryam (as) was amazed and said that no man had ever touched her. The angel told her that this was a command from Allah and that nothing is impossible for Allah. Her child would be a sign for the people and a mercy from Allah.\n\nMaryam (as) became pregnant with Prophet Isa (Jesus, as) by the will of Allah, without a father. When the time of birth came, she went to a secluded place, feeling great pain and sadness. She worried about what people would say and how she would face them.\n\nIn that difficult moment, Allah comforted her. She was told not to grieve, and a spring of water flowed near her. She was commanded to shake the trunk of a palm tree, and fresh dates fell for her to eat and regain strength.\n\nAfter Isa (as) was born, Maryam (as) returned to her people with her baby in her arms. They were shocked and accused her without thinking, forgetting her pure character.\n\nAllah commanded Maryam (as) to remain silent and point to her baby when they questioned her. When the people said a baby cannot speak, Isa (as) — still an infant in the cradle — spoke by Allah’s permission. He declared that he was a servant of Allah and a prophet, and that Allah had blessed him.\n\nFrom the story of Maryam (as), we learn about purity, modesty, sincere worship, and trusting Allah even in the loneliest and most frightening moments. We also learn that Allah can create in any way He wills, and that honor with Allah is not about wealth or status, but about a heart connected to Him.",

    "body": "Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was born in the city of Makkah, among the tribe of Quraysh. His father, Abdullah, passed away before he was born, and his mother, Amina, passed away when he was still very young. He grew up as an orphan, yet Allah always protected and guided him.\n\nAt first, his grandfather Abdul Muttalib cared for him with great love. After his grandfather passed away, his uncle Abu Talib took him into his care and treated him like his own son. Despite the difficult beginning of his life, the Prophet (ﷺ) did not become bitter or harsh. He grew into a gentle, kind, and thoughtful young man.\n\nAs a child, he never bowed to idols and did not take part in the wrong customs and festivals of his people. He stayed away from drinking alcohol, lying, cheating, and bad behavior. The people of Makkah noticed his honesty and fairness in everything he did.\n\nWhen he grew older, he worked as a shepherd and cared for sheep. This taught him patience, mercy, and responsibility, because shepherds must protect and carefully lead their flock. Later, he worked as a merchant and helped people with their business.\n\nIn trade, he was completely honest. He did not hide defects in goods and did not raise prices unfairly. He spoke calmly, never shouted, and never broke his promises. Because of this, people trusted him deeply and gave him the noble nickname “Al-Amin,” meaning “the trustworthy.”\n\nA noble woman named Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her) heard about his honesty and character. She asked him to manage some of her trade journeys. When her servant returned, he told her how kind, respectful, and reliable Muhammad (ﷺ) was during the trip.\n\nKhadijah (ra) admired his character, and later they married. She became his loving and loyal wife, and Allah blessed them with children. Their home was filled with warmth, mercy, and respect.\n\nEven before he became a prophet, Muhammad (ﷺ) felt uncomfortable with the wrong things happening in Makkah. People worshipped idols, cheated in trade, and were unjust to the weak and poor. His heart was pure, and he knew these actions could not be the right path.\n\nFrom his early life we see that Allah was preparing him for a عظيمة mission. He grew up patient and strong through hardship, gentle and honest with people, and always far from shirk and bad habits.\n\nFrom this part of his story, we learn that a difficult start does not prevent a person from being beloved to Allah. We also learn that good manners, honesty, and purity are the foundation of a believer’s life.",

    "body": "As Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) grew older, he became increasingly saddened and affected by the idol worship and injustice around him in Makkah. His heart was pure, and he longed to be close to Allah. He would spend time alone in a cave called Hira, on a mountain just outside Makkah.\n\nHe would take food and water with him and remain there for several nights, reflecting deeply, remembering Allah, and thinking about creation. This quiet time helped him detach from the noise and sins of the city and connect with his Lord.\n\nWhen he was about forty years old, something remarkable happened. One night in the month of Ramadan, while he was in the Cave of Hira, the angel Jibreel (Gabriel, peace be upon him) came to him. The angel said to him: “Read.”\n\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) replied that he could not read. The angel repeated the command, and then, by Allah’s permission, recited the first verses of the Qur’an. These verses spoke about reading in the name of Allah—the One who created us.\n\nThis was the beginning of revelation and the start of his mission as the final messenger. The Prophet (ﷺ) was deeply shaken and overwhelmed by this powerful experience. He quickly left the cave and returned home to his wife Khadijah (ra), his heart trembling.\n\nHe said, “Cover me, cover me,” and she wrapped him in a cloak and comforted him. He told her what had happened and how the angel came with the words of Allah. Khadijah (ra) listened carefully and did not doubt him for a moment.\n\nShe reminded him of his noble qualities: that he maintained family ties, helped the poor, honored guests, and supported people in difficult times. She said Allah would never disgrace someone with such noble character. She believed in him immediately and became the first person to accept Islam.\n\nKhadijah (ra) then took him to a wise man named Waraqah ibn Nawfal, who knew the earlier scriptures. After hearing what had happened, Waraqah said that the angel who came to him was the same angel who came to Musa (as), and that Muhammad (ﷺ) had truly been chosen as a prophet.\n\nAfter this moment, revelation paused for a short time, and the Prophet (ﷺ) felt a strong longing and also fear as he wondered when it would come again. Then more verses came, calling him to rise and warn people, purify his heart, and rely on Allah alone.\n\nFrom this part of the story, we learn that guidance is a gift from Allah, that knowledge must be connected to faith (“Read in the name of your Lord”), and that a supportive, believing family—like Khadijah (ra)—is a great blessing.",

They called people to worship Allah alone, abandon idols, and live with good character and pure hearts. At first, he did not call everyone openly. Instead, he began with those closest to him.\n\nThe very first person to believe in him was his wife Khadijah (ra). After her, his young cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib (ra), who lived in his household, accepted Islam. His freed servant and adopted son, Zaid ibn Harithah (ra), also believed in him very early.\n\nHis close friend Abu Bakr (ra), who knew his honesty better than anyone, accepted Islam without hesitation. Abu Bakr (ra) was gentle and respected among the people, and he quietly invited others to Islam. Through him, many early companions accepted Islam, including Uthman ibn Affan, Talha, Zubair, and others (may Allah be pleased with them all).\n\nBecause the people of Quraysh were deeply attached to idol worship and their old traditions, the Prophet (ﷺ) did not yet call everyone openly. The Muslims gathered secretly to learn the Qur’an, pray, and strengthen their faith. One of the places where they met was the house of a man named Al-Arqam, near the Ka‘bah. This house became a small school of faith and patience.\n\nThe first Muslims already faced many trials, even during this secret phase. Some families became angry when they discovered that a family member had accepted Islam. But the believers knew that Allah saw them, and they remained patient.\n\nDuring these early years, the Qur’an focused mainly on building the heart: teaching the Oneness of Allah, the Hereafter, Paradise and Hell, and the stories of earlier prophets. The believers learned to love Allah, fear disobeying Him, and care for one another.\n\nEven though they were few in number, Allah honored them. They were not strong in wealth or weapons, but strong in faith, trust in Allah, and love for the Prophet (ﷺ).\n\nSlowly, more people from different backgrounds joined them: young and old, rich and poor, free people and slaves. Islam welcomed them all and taught that the best person is the one with the most piety, not the one with the most wealth or status.\n\nFrom this part of the story, we learn that Allah often begins great changes with a small, sincere group. We also learn that true strength comes from faith and good character, not from large numbers or worldly power.\n\nThe early Muslims planted the seeds for a strong future community, even as they learned quietly in the house of Al-Arqam.",

He climbed a hill near the Ka‘bah and called the different families of Quraysh by name to gather and listen.\n\nHe asked them: “If I were to tell you that an enemy army was waiting behind this mountain to attack, would you believe me?” They replied: “Yes, we have never known you to lie.” He then warned them of a severe punishment and called them to worship Allah alone.\n\nSome listened, but many rejected the message. His own uncle Abu Lahab insulted him and told the people to turn away from him. Others mocked him, called him names, and tried to prevent people from listening to the Qur’an.\n\nAs more people accepted Islam, the leaders of Quraysh feared losing their power and their idol-based trade. They tried different offers: wealth, leadership, and marriage to the most noble women, if he would stop calling to Islam. The Prophet (ﷺ) firmly refused and said that even if they placed the sun in his right hand and the moon in his left, he would never abandon his mission.\n\nThe Muslims, especially the weak and enslaved, were tortured and abused. Some were dragged across burning sand, others were beaten or starved. Although the Prophet (ﷺ) could not always physically stop it, he encouraged them with words of hope and promised them Jannah if they remained patient.\n\nBilal ibn Rabah (ra), a slave who accepted Islam, was tortured by his master. He was laid on scorching ground with heavy stones on his chest, yet he kept repeating: “Ahad, Ahad” – “One, One,” declaring that Allah is One.\n\nBecause of the persecution, the Prophet (ﷺ) advised some Muslims to migrate to Abyssinia (Habasha), a land ruled by a just Christian king, where they could live safely and practice their faith.\n\nBack in Makkah, Quraysh imposed a social and economic boycott on the family and supporters of the Prophet (ﷺ). They were forced to live in a narrow valley and suffered hunger and hardship for years. Still, they remained patient and trusted Allah.\n\nDuring this period, the Prophet (ﷺ) also experienced personal loss. His beloved wife Khadijah (ra) passed away, and shortly after, his uncle Abu Talib, who had protected him, also died. This year became known as the “Year of Sorrow.”\n\nFrom this part of the story, we learn that following the truth does not mean life will always be easy. True faith shines through patience, courage, and trust in Allah during the hardest times.",

    "body": "After many years of persecution in Makkah, Allah opened a new door of hope. Some people from a city called Yathrib (later known as Madinah) heard the message of Islam during Hajj and accepted it. They returned to their city and invited others to believe.\n\nSoon, groups from Yathrib secretly met the Prophet (ﷺ) near Makkah. They pledged to believe in Allah, support the Prophet (ﷺ), and protect him if he came to their city. This marked a major turning point in Islamic history.\n\nAllah granted the Prophet (ﷺ) permission to migrate. He instructed his followers to leave Makkah quietly and travel to Yathrib. They left behind their homes, possessions, and wealth for the sake of Allah, trusting that He would care for them.\n\nThe leaders of Quraysh became angry and plotted to kill the Prophet (ﷺ). By Allah’s permission, he left Makkah at night with his close companion Abu Bakr (ra). They hid for several days in a cave called Thawr while their enemies searched for them.\n\nAt one point, the pursuers reached the entrance of the cave. Abu Bakr (ra) became worried—not for himself, but for the Prophet (ﷺ). The Prophet (ﷺ) reassured him, saying that Allah was with them. Allah protected them, and the enemies turned back without seeing them.\n\nAfterwards, they traveled to Yathrib, where the people welcomed them with joy. They sang and celebrated, grateful to receive the Messenger of Allah in their city. From that moment, Yathrib became known as Madinat an-Nabi—the City of the Prophet.\n\nIn Madinah, the Prophet (ﷺ) built a mosque, which became the center of worship, knowledge, and community life. He also established brotherhood between the Muslims who migrated from Makkah (the Muhajirun) and the Muslims of Madinah (the Ansar). They shared their homes, food, and wealth with one another.\n\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) also established fair agreements with other groups in Madinah, including non-Muslims, to live together in peace and justice. Everyone in the city had rights and responsibilities.\n\nFrom this part of the story, we learn that leaving something for the sake of Allah is never a loss. The Hijrah was difficult, but it led to a strong, loving, and well-organized Muslim community.\n\nWe also learn the importance of brotherhood, sharing, and building a society based on justice, mercy, and the worship of Allah.",

The enemies in Makkah still wanted to destroy Islam, and some groups around Madinah also opposed the new Muslim community.\n\nNot long after the Hijrah, a famous battle took place at a location called Badr. The Muslims were few in number and had limited equipment, while the army of Quraysh was much larger and better prepared. The Prophet (ﷺ) made sincere dua to Allah, asking for His help and victory.\n\nBy Allah’s mercy, the Muslims won the Battle of Badr. It was a clear sign that Allah supports those who rely on Him and follow His Messenger, even when they appear weaker by worldly standards.\n\nLater, another major battle took place at Uhud. At first, the Muslims were winning, but some of the archers left their position to collect spoils, even though the Prophet (ﷺ) had commanded them to stay. The enemy took advantage of this and attacked from behind.\n\nMany Muslims were injured and some became martyrs. The Prophet (ﷺ) himself was wounded, and his helmet pressed into his blessed face. This was a painful lesson for the believers about the importance of complete obedience to the Prophet (ﷺ), especially in times of danger.\n\nLater, a third great trial came when many tribes united to attack Madinah. This is known as the Battle of the Trench (Al-Khandaq). On the advice of a companion, Salman al-Farisi (ra), the Muslims dug a long trench around part of the city so the enemies could not enter easily.\n\nThe weather was cold, food was scarce, and fear was widespread. Yet the Muslims remained steadfast, trusting Allah and staying united as a community. In the end, Allah sent strong winds and confusion among the enemies, and they withdrew without defeating the Muslims.\n\nThroughout these trials, the Prophet (ﷺ) showed courage, patience, and deep trust in Allah. He also always sought peaceful solutions whenever possible. Later, he made a peace treaty with Quraysh at a place called Hudaybiyyah, even though some Muslims found its terms difficult to accept at first.\n\nThis treaty later proved to be a great victory, because it gave the Muslims time to spread Islam peacefully.

He did not go for revenge, but to end oppression and open the city for the worship of Allah alone.\n\nWhen the Muslims entered Makkah, there was very little fighting. The Prophet (ﷺ) showed great humility: he lowered his head on his camel out of gratitude to Allah, even as he returned to the city as its powerful leader.\n\nHe declared safety for those who stayed in their homes, those who went to the Ka‘bah, and those who stayed in the house of Abu Sufyan. Instead of punishing the people who had hurt him for years, he forgave most of them.\n\nHe entered the Ka‘bah and removed the idols around it. He proclaimed that truth had come and falsehood had vanished. The House of Allah was purified again for the worship of Allah alone.\n\nSoon after, many tribes sent delegations to Madinah to accept Islam. The message that began in a small secret gathering in Makkah had now spread across the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nIn the final years of his life, the Prophet (ﷺ) performed his only complete Hajj, known as the Farewell Pilgrimage. During this Hajj, he delivered a powerful sermon to the people on the plain of ‘Arafah.\n\nIn his sermon, he reminded the Muslims to fear Allah, treat women well, avoid interest (riba) and oppression, and hold firmly to the Qur’an and his Sunnah. He taught that all people are equal in worth regardless of skin color or background, and that the best of them are those with the most taqwa (God-consciousness).\n\nNot long after, the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) became ill. Even while sick, he continued advising the Muslims, reminding them about prayer and caring for those under their responsibility. Then his blessed soul returned to Allah, and the Muslims were filled with grief.\n\nFrom this final part of his story, we learn that his life was a complete example of mercy, justice, and worship. He forgave when he had power, he was humble when he was honored, and he never forgot Allah in any moment of his life.\n\nTruly loving the Prophet (ﷺ) means following his teachings and character in our daily lives: being honest, kind, fair, patient, and always returning to Allah with a sincere heart.",

    "body": "Prophet Musa (peace be upon him) was born in Egypt at a time when Pharaoh was a cruel ruler. Pharaoh feared that a boy from the Children of Israel would one day challenge his power, so he ordered that newborn boys from Bani Isra’il be killed.\n\nAllah inspired the mother of baby Musa (as) to place him in a small basket and set it afloat on the river. She did so with a heart full of fear, but also full of trust in Allah. Allah guided the basket safely until it reached Pharaoh’s palace. There, Pharaoh’s wife, Asiyah (may Allah be pleased with her), found the baby. She felt mercy and love for him and convinced Pharaoh to let the child live and be raised in the palace.\n\nSo Musa (as) grew up under Allah’s care, in the home of the very man who wanted boys like him killed. When he became older and stronger, he witnessed the injustice Pharaoh and his people inflicted upon the Children of Israel. One day Musa (as) saw a man from his own people being attacked by an Egyptian. Musa (as) intervened and struck the Egyptian, but the man died from the blow. Musa (as) did not intend to kill him. He immediately turned back to Allah, asked for forgiveness, and Allah forgave him.\n\nAfter this, Musa (as) left Egypt in fear and traveled to the land of Madyan. There he helped two sisters who struggled to water their animals while others went ahead of them. He moved the heavy stone from the well for them, showing strength and good manners. Later he was invited to their home and eventually married one of them. He remained in Madyan for many years, living a simple and honest life.\n\nOne day, while traveling back toward Egypt with his family, Musa (as) saw a fire on the side of a mountain. He went toward it, and there, at Mount Tur, Allah spoke to him. Allah chose him as a messenger and commanded him to go to Pharaoh: to call him to worship Allah alone, to free the Children of Israel, and to stop his oppression.\n\nMusa (as) felt afraid and hesitant, so he asked Allah to strengthen him and to appoint his brother Harun (as) as a helper. Allah accepted his dua and granted him miracles. One miracle was that his staff, by Allah’s permission, would turn into a real snake. Another was that his hand would shine brightly when he brought it out from under his arm.\n\nWith these signs, Musa (as) went to Pharaoh and spoke calmly but clearly: to worship Allah alone and to be just. Pharaoh became arrogant and refused. He called the magicians of Egypt to challenge Musa (as). The magicians threw their ropes and staffs, and it looked as if they were moving snakes. By Allah’s command, Musa (as) threw down his staff, and it turned into a real snake that swallowed up all their tricks. The magicians realized this was not magic, but a true miracle from Allah. They believed in Allah and fell into sujood, even when Pharaoh threatened them.\n\nAfter many signs and punishments that Allah sent upon Pharaoh and his people, they still refused to believe. Then Allah commanded Musa (as) to lead the Children of Israel out of Egypt. They traveled by night toward the sea. When they reached the water, they saw Pharaoh and his army chasing them from behind. Some of Bani Isra’il panicked and said, “We will surely be caught!” But Musa (as) replied with complete trust in Allah: “No! My Lord is with me; He will guide me.”\n\nAllah then commanded Musa (as) to strike the sea with his staff. The sea split into paths, like towering walls of water, and the ground became dry. Musa (as) and his people crossed safely. When Pharaoh and his army tried to follow, the sea closed again and they drowned. The people who had been weak and oppressed were saved by Allah’s mercy.\n\nAfter their escape, Allah called Musa (as) to Mount Sinai for a special meeting. Musa (as) fasted and prepared for many nights. There, Allah spoke to him and gave him the Tablets with His commands for the people—this is the Tawrah (Torah), a book of guidance and law. It taught them how to worship Allah, how to deal justly with one another, and how to remain grateful after being saved from Pharaoh.\n\nWhile Musa (as) was away, some of his people made a major mistake. A man among them, Samiri, made a calf of gold, and some of Bani Isra’il began to worship it. When Musa (as) returned and saw this, he was deeply saddened and angered. He reminded them of Allah’s blessings and called them to repent. Those who were sincere repented, and Allah accepted the repentance of the sincere. But it became a clear lesson about how easily people can stray when they forget Allah.\n\nThe story of Musa (as) continues with many challenges: leading his people through the desert, dealing with their complaints, and teaching them patience and trust. Through all of this, Musa (as) remained a strong, courageous, and humble servant of Allah. He often turned to Allah in dua, asking for help, patience, and clear speech, and he always knew that success comes only from Allah.\n\nFrom the story of Prophet Musa (as) we learn to trust Allah even in the hardest situations, to stand up against oppression, and to be brave while keeping our hearts connected to Allah. We also learn that Allah can open a way out where we could never imagine—just as He opened a path through the sea—and that after every rescue we must remain grateful and not fall back into disobedience.",

    "body": "Prophet Nuh (peace be upon him) was sent to a people who had forgotten Allah and had begun worshipping idols. They made statues and gave them names, hoping these idols would bring them closer to Allah. But these idols could not hear, could not see, and could not help anyone.\n\nAllah chose Nuh (as) to remind his people of the truth. He called them day and night, publicly and privately, with gentle words and clear warnings. He told them that Allah is their true Lord, that they should worship Him alone, and that they should seek forgiveness.\n\nNuh (as) spoke with tremendous patience for many, many years—some narrations mention 950 years of calling his people. Yet most refused to listen. They put their fingers in their ears, pulled their clothes over their heads, and turned away whenever he spoke. They mocked him and called him names, but he did not stop inviting them to Allah.\n\nOnly a small group believed in him. These believers were not always rich or powerful; many were simple, humble people. The community leaders looked down on them and used them as an excuse not to follow Nuh (as).\n\nAfter a very long time of da‘wah and rejection, Nuh (as) made dua to Allah and asked for help. Allah informed him that no one else would believe except those who had already believed. Then Allah gave Nuh (as) a special command: to build a great ark (ship) under Allah’s guidance.\n\nNuh (as) began building the ark far from the sea. The disbelievers laughed at him and ridiculed him, saying, “Have you become a carpenter now?” They could not understand why a ship was being built on dry land.\n\nWhen the ark was finished, Allah commanded Nuh (as) to take the believers aboard and take pairs of animals. Then the sky began to pour with heavy rain, and water burst forth from the earth. The water rose and rose until it covered houses, trees, and mountains. The great flood had begun.\n\nInside the ark, Nuh (as) and the believers were safe by Allah’s mercy. The ship sailed over powerful waves while the land was drowned beneath the water. Nuh (as) trusted Allah completely during this frightening time.\n\nAmong those who refused to board the ark was one of Nuh’s own sons. Nuh (as) felt deep sadness and called to him, urging him to come aboard to be safe. But his son chose to rely on a mountain instead of Allah’s command, and he was lost in the flood.\n\nAfter some time, the rain stopped and the waters slowly receded. The ark came to rest on a mountain. Nuh (as) and the believers left the ship and began a new life, building a new community based on faith in Allah.\n\nFrom the story of Nuh (as), we learn patience in da‘wah, trusting Allah even when others laugh at us, and understanding that true safety lies in obeying Allah—not in things or places.\n\nWe also learn that guidance is in Allah’s hands. Our duty is to invite others kindly and remain steadfast, just as Nuh (as) did for so many years.",

    "body": "Prophet Shuʿayb (peace be upon him) was sent to the people of Madyan. They lived in a town full of trade, markets, and business. Instead of being grateful to Allah, many became greedy. They cheated people when buying and selling, gave less in measure and weight, and tried to earn more money through unfair ways. They also worshipped false gods besides Allah.\n\nAllah sent Shuʿayb (as) as a messenger to guide them back to the straight path. He spoke to them kindly but firmly. He called them to worship Allah alone, to stop cheating people, and to be honest in their trade. He warned them that cheating in business is a serious sin and that Allah sees everything we do.\n\nShuʿayb (as) reminded his people of the blessings Allah had given them: fertile land, trade routes, and provision. He told them that if they were honest and grateful, Allah would increase their blessings. But if they continued their wrongdoing, a punishment could come.\n\nMany leaders of his people did not like this message. They loved their money and power. They mocked Shuʿayb (as) and told him to stop speaking about honesty. Some threatened to drive him and his followers out of the town if they did not return to the old ways. Shuʿayb (as) remained patient and calm.

A terrible cry and an earthquake struck them. In an instant, their town and homes were destroyed, and those who denied the truth were left lifeless in their dwellings. Allah saved Shuʿayb (as) and those who believed with him.\n\nFrom the story of Prophet Shuʿayb (as), we learn that Islam is not only about prayer and fasting, but also about honesty in trade and daily life.

    "body": "Prophet Sulayman (peace be upon him) was the son of Prophet Dawud (David, as). Allah blessed him with a remarkable kingdom, great wisdom, and many gifts. One of his special gifts was that, by Allah’s permission, he could understand the language of animals and birds.\n\nSulayman (as) knew that all power and knowledge come only from Allah. He did not become arrogant because of his gifts. Rather, he stayed humble and always thanked Allah. He was a just ruler who cared for people, animals, and even small creatures like ants.\n\nOne day, Prophet Sulayman (as) set out with his army. His army was unique: it included humans, jinn, and birds, all arranged in orderly ranks. As they passed through a valley of ants, one small ant saw the army approaching and became worried. The ant called out to the other ants to quickly enter their homes so that Sulayman (as) and his army would not accidentally crush them.\n\nAllah allowed Sulayman (as) to hear the words of this small ant. When he heard what it said, he smiled gently and laughed kindly—not in mockery, but in appreciation. He was moved by the ant’s concern for its community. Immediately, he turned to Allah in gratitude and made du‘a, asking Allah to help him be thankful for His blessings and to do righteous deeds that please Him.\n\nAnother well-known part of his story involves the hoopoe bird (al-hudhud). One day, Sulayman (as) noticed the hoopoe was missing from its place in the army. A king might become angry, but Sulayman (as) first waited to hear the bird’s reason before deciding. When the hoopoe returned, it brought important news.\n\nThe hoopoe told Sulayman (as) about a distant land called Saba (Sheba), ruled by a queen. The people there had many blessings, but instead of worshipping Allah, they worshipped the sun. The hoopoe had seen their strong kingdom and their throne, but also their wrong way of worship.\n\nProphet Sulayman (as) wanted to invite them to the truth, not take their land. He wrote a kind but clear letter in the name of Allah, the Most Merciful. In the letter, he invited the queen and her people to stop worshipping the sun and to submit to Allah alone. The hoopoe delivered the letter and left it with the queen.\n\nThe Queen of Sheba was wise. She did not rush into war. She consulted her advisors and decided to visit Sulayman (as) to see for herself. Before she arrived, Sulayman (as) wanted to show her that his power came from Allah. He asked who could bring her throne to him before she reached his court. By Allah’s permission, a strong jinn brought the throne very quickly. And someone who had knowledge from the Book brought it even faster—in the blink of an eye.\n\nWhen Sulayman (as) saw the throne placed before him, he did not boast. Instead, he said this was a test from his Lord: to see whether he would be grateful or ungrateful. This shows that even with something extraordinary, he remained aware that it came from Allah.\n\nWhen the queen met Sulayman (as), she saw his justice, good manners, and the signs of Allah’s power. She realized that her people’s worship was wrong. In the end, she accepted the truth and submitted to Allah together with Sulayman (as).\n\nThroughout his life, Prophet Sulayman (as) remained a grateful servant of Allah. Even though he had a mighty kingdom, he never forgot that he was only a servant of his Lord.\n\nFrom the story of Prophet Sulayman (as), we learn to be grateful for our blessings, to stay humble when we have power or knowledge, to be kind to all creatures, and to use our influence in a way that pleases Allah. We also learn that wisdom means thinking carefully, listening to others, and always putting Allah first.",

Yunus (as) called them with patience and sincerity: to worship Allah alone, leave their idols, and live righteously.\n\nBut most people rejected him. They argued with him, mocked him, and ignored his warnings. After a long time, Yunus (as) felt deep sadness. He warned them that Allah’s punishment could come if they remained in disbelief. Yet he left—before Allah gave him permission—out of frustration, thinking his people would never believe.\n\nYunus (as) traveled toward the sea and boarded a ship. At first, the ship sailed calmly. Then a severe storm came and the sea became violent. The ship was about to sink. The sailors decided to lighten the load by throwing one passenger overboard. They drew lots to decide who it would be. By Allah’s will, the name of Yunus (as) was chosen. They drew again, and again his name came out. A third time the same happened. Yunus (as) understood this was Allah’s decision, accepted it, and was thrown into the dark sea.\n\nAs he fell into the waves, Allah commanded a huge whale to swallow him completely without harming him. Suddenly Yunus (as) found himself alive inside the belly of the whale, in layers of darkness: the darkness of the night, the darkness of the sea, and the darkness inside the whale.\n\nIn that state, Yunus (as) realized he had left his people without Allah’s permission. He turned to Allah completely, with regret and humility. He blamed no one else. He recited the well-known du‘a:\n\n“Laa ilaaha illa Anta, subhaanaka, inni kuntu minaz-zaalimiin.”\n\nMeaning: “There is no god except You. You are perfect. Indeed, I was among the wrongdoers.”\n\nHe repeated this du‘a again and again, glorifying Allah and asking forgiveness. Allah, in His mercy, accepted his repentance. He commanded the whale to go to the shore and release him. The whale approached land and gently left Yunus (as) on the beach.\n\nWhen he came out, Yunus (as) was weak and ill. Allah caused a special plant with large leaves to grow over him, giving him shade and protection. Allah provided him with nourishment and strength until he recovered.\n\nThen Allah sent him back to the same people he had left. While Yunus (as) was away, the people saw signs that a punishment was approaching. They became afraid and truly regretted their disbelief. Together they returned to Allah, repented, and asked forgiveness before the punishment reached them. Allah forgave the entire city and removed the punishment from them.\n\nWhen Yunus (as) returned, he found that his people believed. They became a community that worshipped Allah alone. Allah mentions this in the Qur’an as a special example.\n\nFrom the story of Prophet Yunus (as), we learn many lessons: patience when calling others to what is good, never despairing of Allah’s mercy, and always returning to Him with sincere tawbah—even when we make mistakes. Allah can rescue us from every kind of “darkness” when we call upon Him sincerely.",

    "body": "Prophet Yusuf (peace be upon him) was the son of Prophet Ya‘qub (Jacob, as). As a young boy, Yusuf (as) had a beautiful and pure character. One night he saw a special dream. In his dream, he saw eleven stars, the sun, and the moon bowing down to him. He told this dream to his father.\n\nHis father understood that the dream was from Allah and that Yusuf (as) would be honored greatly later on. With love, he advised Yusuf (as) not to tell this dream to his brothers, because he knew some of them felt jealous of him.\n\nYusuf’s brothers were many. They felt that their father loved Yusuf (as) and his younger brother more than them. Jealousy slowly grew in their hearts. Instead of fighting that feeling and trusting Allah, they let it control them. They made a plan to get rid of Yusuf (as). Some wanted to kill him, while others suggested a less severe step: throw him into a deep well so that travelers would pick him up.\n\nThey asked their father for permission to take Yusuf (as) outside to play. Ya‘qub (as) was worried and said that a wolf might harm him. But the brothers insisted and promised to protect him. When they had the chance, they took Yusuf (as), threw him into a dark, deep well, and left him there alone.\n\nThey returned to their father crying and brought Yusuf’s shirt with fake blood on it. They claimed that a wolf had eaten Yusuf (as). Ya‘qub (as) knew in his heart that their story was not true, but he turned to Allah with patience and said that “beautiful patience” (sabr jameel) was the best response.\n\nMeanwhile, a caravan of travelers passed by the well. One of them lowered a bucket and was shocked to find a boy holding onto it. They pulled Yusuf (as) out and decided to sell him as a slave in Egypt. He was bought by a high official, often called al-‘Aziz, who told his wife to treat Yusuf (as) well.\n\nAs Yusuf (as) grew up in Egypt, he became known for his honesty, manners, and beauty. The wife of al-‘Aziz tried to tempt him into sin, but he refused and said that he feared Allah. She locked the doors and called him, but he chose Allah over desire. As he rushed toward the door, she tore his shirt from the back. Later, someone from the household testified that Yusuf (as) was innocent.\n\nEven though he was innocent, Yusuf (as) was sent to prison to protect the palace’s reputation. In prison, he remained righteous and spoke gently about Allah. Two men in prison had strange dreams and asked Yusuf (as) to explain them. By Allah’s permission, he explained their dreams correctly.\n\nLater, the king of Egypt had a troubling dream: seven fat cows eaten by seven thin cows, and seven green ears of grain with seven dry ones. No one could explain it, until one of the former prisoners remembered Yusuf (as). Yusuf (as) explained that it was a message from Allah: seven years of abundant harvest would come, followed by seven years of severe famine. He also gave wise advice to store food during the good years.\n\nThe king was impressed and wanted Yusuf (as) brought to him. But Yusuf (as) first asked for his innocence to be made clear. Eventually, the truth about what happened with the women in the palace was admitted. Yusuf (as) was declared innocent and honored by the king. He was given a high position and made responsible for the grain storehouses.\n\nWhen the years of famine came, people from many lands traveled to Egypt to buy food. Among them were Yusuf’s brothers. They did not recognize him, but he recognized them. With wisdom, he tested their hearts and eventually managed to bring his younger brother close to him.\n\nOver time, after several meetings, Yusuf (as) revealed his true identity to his brothers. They felt deep regret for what they had done to him long ago. Instead of taking revenge, Yusuf (as) forgave them and said that there would be no blame upon them that day. He saw how Allah had guided the entire story and raised him in rank.\n\nIn the end, Yusuf (as) invited his parents and his whole family to Egypt. They came and were reunited with him. At that moment, his childhood dream came true: it was as if the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars bowed to him—meaning his parents and his eleven brothers honored him. He thanked Allah for His mercy throughout his life.\n\nFrom the story of Prophet Yusuf (as), we learn the power of patience, purity, trusting Allah, and forgiveness. Even when others ظلم us, Allah can bring great good out of our hardship if we remain patient and stay close to Him.",

His mother placed complete trust in Allah, and Allah blessed them with the miracle of the Zamzam spring.\n\nAs Ismail (as) grew older, he became known for his patience, honesty, and obedience to Allah. He learned to rely upon Allah in every situation and supported his father in fulfilling Allah’s commands.\n\nOne day, Prophet Ibrahim (as) saw in a dream that Allah commanded him to sacrifice his son. The dreams of prophets are true, so Ibrahim (as) knew this was a test from Allah. With a heavy heart, he shared the dream with Ismail (as).\n\nIsmail (as) responded with remarkable faith. He told his father to do what Allah had commanded and promised to remain patient. His response showed his deep trust in Allah and his desire to please Him above all else.\n\nWhen they were ready to carry out the command, Allah stopped them and replaced Ismail (as) with a ram. Through this, Allah showed that He did not want harm, but obedience and sincerity.\n\nLater, Ismail (as) worked together with his father to build the Kaaba in Makkah. Together they raised its foundations and prayed that Allah would accept their efforts. The Kaaba became a place of worship for all who believe in Allah alone.\n\nIsmail (as) later became a prophet who guided people to worship Allah and live righteously. He was known for keeping his promises, speaking the truth, and leading by example.\n\nFrom the story of Ismail (as) we learn the beauty of obedience, patience, and complete trust in Allah.

They were skilled builders and had great strength, but they became arrogant and forgot to worship Allah alone.\n\nInstead, the people of Thamud worshipped idols and refused to believe that their strength and success came from Allah. Salih (as) called them gently but clearly to leave the idols and return to worshipping the One True God. He reminded them that all blessings come from Allah and that they should be grateful.\n\nThe people mocked Salih (as) and demanded a miracle as proof of his message. They challenged him to bring a sign from Allah if he truly was a prophet.\n\nBy Allah’s permission, a miraculous she-camel emerged from a massive rock right before their eyes. Salih (as) said this camel was a sign from Allah and warned them not to harm her. On certain days she would drink from the water, and on other days the people would drink.\n\nThis was a test for the people of Thamud, but many remained arrogant. Instead of obeying Allah, a group plotted and killed the camel, thinking they could escape punishment.\n\nSalih (as) was deeply saddened and warned them that Allah’s punishment would come after three days. Despite this warning, the people did not repent and did not seek forgiveness.\n\nWhen the time passed, a mighty punishment struck Thamud. A powerful blast/shock destroyed them, and their carved homes were left empty and silent. Salih (as) and the believers were saved by Allah’s mercy.\n\nFrom the story of Salih (as) we learn that miracles are not enough for those who refuse to humble their hearts.

    "body": "Prophet Zakariya (peace be upon him) was a gentle and devoted prophet who served Allah and taught his people to worship Him alone. He lived simply, spending much time in worship and caring for the place of prayer.\n\nZakariya (as) cared for Maryam (as) when she was still a young girl devoted to worship. He would visit her in her prayer chamber and often find fruit and food there that no one had brought. When he asked her where it came from, she replied that it was from Allah—because Allah provides for whom He wills without limit.\n\nSeeing these blessings with Maryam (as) made Zakariya (as) reflect deeply. He and his wife were very old and had no children, yet he still longed for a righteous child who would continue goodness and the message of worship after him. So, with a sincere heart, he raised his hands and made du‘a.\n\nHe did not complain about his age, and he did not lose hope. With trust and humility, he asked Allah to grant him a child—an heir who would please Allah. Allah answered his du‘a in a beautiful way.\n\nAngels came to Zakariya (as) with glad tidings: Allah would bless him with a son named Yahya. This child would be pure, gentle, and a prophet of Allah. Zakariya (as) was amazed and asked how this could be possible while he was old and his wife could not bear children, but Allah reminded him that He creates whatever He wills.\n\nAs a sign, Allah told Zakariya (as) that for three days he would not be able to speak to people, except by gestures—while remaining otherwise healthy. During those days, he was instructed to remember Allah often and praise Him morning and evening.\n\nYahya (as) was born exactly as Allah promised. He grew into a righteous, kind, and humble prophet—just as Zakariya (as) had hoped. He called people to obey Allah, spoke with wisdom, and became known for purity and honesty.\n\nFrom the story of Zakariya (as) we learn the power of du‘a and that we must never give up hope in Allah, even when something seems impossible. We also learn that righteous children are a blessing and a trust from Allah—not only for our happiness, but to help goodness continue in the world.",
